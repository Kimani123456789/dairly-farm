    <h1>Milk Farm Project</h1>
    <p>You just landed yourself a great deal and acquired a farm upcountry that has dairy cattle.
        These cows are well fed and they produce a fair amount of milk every day.
        Luckily, Brookside Dairies has also called you in, for yet another deal to
        sell your milk produce to them for processing. There's one problem though,
        you're very engaged in a website consultation company which leaves very little
        time for you to monitor milk production at your farm. Your cows will make you rich if
        you monitor their milk production and sale, and you have skills to build a program with
        JavaScript that helps you monitor production and sales. Here's a document of what you have on
        your farm. Assume that this is a day's production: </p>
        <table>
           <tr>
               <th>SHED NO</th>
               <td> No. of COWS</td>
               <td> Avarange production (litres per cow)</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
               <th> Shed A</th>
               <td>34</td>
               <td>15</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
               <th>SHED B</th>
               <td>11</td>
               <td>28</td>
               
           </tr>
           <tr>
            <th>SHED c</th>
            <td>27</td>
            <td>18</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
            <th>SHED D</th>
            <td>52</td>
            <td>11</td>
           </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Brookside Dairies has signed a contract with you to buy milk at Ksh.45 per litre for one year.
            Your mission, if you choose to accept it is to automate the process of getting reports about your farm by
            writing a function that gives you a report on how much milk is produced per shed and the total amount of
            milk produced by all sheds.
            For example:
            <code>totalProduction();</code><br /><br /><br /><br />
